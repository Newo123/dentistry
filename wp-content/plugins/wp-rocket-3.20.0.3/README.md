## Usage

This is the **fully activated pro version ("nulled")** of **WP Rocket**, brought to you by [WordPress Premium](https://www.wordpress-premium.net). We thoroughly **scanned and cleaned it of any malware**, then released it so users could try the plugin before purchasing or conducting technical research. If you intend to use this plugin for your website, **you must** [purchase a license](https://wp-rocket.me/pricing/) through the author's official website.

**Note:** Using activated ("nulled") software may violate the original author's licensing terms, and you may not receive official support or updates.

## Support

🚨 Keeping all plugins up to date and malware-free takes a lot of time and effort. **If we do not receive donations, we are forced to shut down the free repositories and only sell to buying members.**
